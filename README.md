# SEG Project 3

A software engineering group project, built in the second semseter of the second year of a KCL Computer Science degree.

Nelly's nursery school in Dulwich requested a photo management software to help deal with hundreds of pictures they take every day accross five sites. The main issue they had was efficiency - a large number of pictures needed to be tagged every week with children names, locations and activities, but this was a relatively low priority task compared to the other roles employees were responsible for.

We implemented a fully working desktop application which was tested on over 3,000 heavy weight pictures at a time, and was found to be quite easy on memory. The main feature we implemented for efficiency was intuitive keyboard functionality that imitates the OS keyboard selection shortcuts. This enables the user to select multiple pictures very quickly and move to the tagging pane of the application by hitting the tab key once.

In the tagging pane an autocomplete feature allows the selection of children and locations very easily. Every child or location added is shown as a tag, similar to what you see when tagging people in Facebook pictures. Another tab hit moves control back to the picture pane for a different selection of pictures.

A search pane was implemented where the user can add any number of search tags, e.g. for find all photos of multiple children in a specific location. The picture pane is binded to the search, and every change of tags in the search pane immediately shows the corresponding pictures.

Basic editing pictures requested by the client were also implemented - picture rotation and printing.

The project was built in Java and Swing.
